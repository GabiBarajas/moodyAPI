This is moody - the hp-adaptive mooring solver
=============================================
or rather, it will be once the full version is released. 

The present version is a discontinuous Galerkin method for mooring dynamics. 
It uses local Lax-Friedrich fluxes to solve the Riemann problem in between
elements and is designed as a mooring library to be used together with
hydrodynamic simulation of moored objects.   
The spatial discretisation of this version uses 4th order Legendre expansion bases.

Please see the user manual for detailed information on the installation and usage of Moody.
